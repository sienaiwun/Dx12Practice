# D3D12 practice
This project is based on Microsfts&copy; [MiniEngine](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/MiniEngine). Besides that I add some toy demos

## Gpu Tiles Culling:
* Accelerate draw-calls submitions using indirect draw calls generated from GPU-based tiles culling.
